# MLSpamTextClassification

This is two machine learning models for text classification, which is used to predict whether a text message is spam or not. The models are trained on a dataset of spam and non-spam texts. The two models are Gaussian Naive Bayes and Random Forest.

Inspired by [this](https://www.kaggle.com/code/paramarthasengupta/beginner-s-guide-to-ml-sms-spam-classifier) using a dataset with 5155 unique entries: [spam-text-message-classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/team-ai/spam-text-message-classification).
